# Content-Based Movie Recommender

Our project is a content-based movie recommender program that recommends movies to users based on the movieâ€™s genre similarity to other movies. It uses the Vector Space Model, which stores movies as a vector of their genres; the cosine between the angles of vectors is calculated to determine the similarity between genres of the movies. 

In addition to the movie recommender, we used a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the gross of movies based on a few movie variables such as IMDB rating, movie budget, and content rating.
